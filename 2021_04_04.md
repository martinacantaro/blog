I recently bought a Lenovo Thinkpad T495 to use as my "lab" computer. 

I installed Linux Void on it (multiple times, to learn about the installation process), the bare bones version, and I'm slowly learning to build up everything I need. 

I'm using dwm as the window manager and the shortcuts are really easy to use. Next step will be customizing and learning to recompile it. 

And, more importantly, setting up the network and audio for my computer. 

Then, setting up a server.

Cool stuff.
